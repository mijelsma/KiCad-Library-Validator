# Component Placement List (CPL)

## Overview

This directory contains the Component Placement List (CPL) in `.csv` format, which details the exact placement of each component on the PCB. The CPL is essential for assembly, providing precise data for automated or manual placement of each component.

### CPL Format

The CPL file includes the following columns:

- **Designator**: Identifies each component (e.g., R1, C2)
- **Comment**: Component type or additional information
- **Description**: Description of the component
- **Value**: Value or rating of the component
- **Package**: Physical package type (e.g., SMD, THT)
- **Layer**: PCB layer where the component is placed (e.g., top, bottom)
- **Center-X**: X-coordinate for component placement
- **Center-Y**: Y-coordinate for component placement
- **Rotation**: Rotation angle of the component for proper alignment
